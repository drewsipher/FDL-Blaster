# Printing your FDL-3

Note: Use your best judgement when slicing nad printing parts. Consider how your printer operates best and what settings you normally use for strong but light parts. This readme should be used as a set of suggestions to get you started but every printer is different. 

- We use common 0.4mm nozzles at 0.2mm layer heights. If using a different size, adjust accordingly.
- We use mostly PLA filament. It prints easily and cleanly without much hassle but can warp in high temperature environments like a hot car. Any other material such as PETG or ABS can be used at your own discretion.
- We typically use 3-5 perimeters (1.2 - 1.6mm) on all parts. Most have 3 but extra are added for structural parts like barrel outers(5), handle cores(4), stock attachment(4) etc
- Infill should be roughly 20% using your favorite infill pattern. Honeycomb and gyroid are great options. Add extra for structural parts like barrel outers(40-50), stock attachment(30) etc
- Prints must be clean and accurate. Too high an extrusion rate can lead to tight fitting parts. Remove and clean any brims or support. Sanding should not be required but may help fitment in areas.
- No support should be necessary on any parts but can help parts with areas of long bridging. Ex. mag gripper and fat boi grip on the 40 nose
- Parts should all be oriented to print. Use your best judgement and don't be afraid to try other orientations.
- Brims are suggested on parts without a lot of bed contact. There are small strands of material across the edges of channels on some parts. These prevent brim from entering wire channels. This should be removed.
- The pusher housing cap has holes that need drilling. Use a 9/64" or xacto blade to clean.
- The pusher housing has holes in it that need drilling. Use a 3mm and 7mm bit or xacto to clean.
- The spinner has a hole in the side that should be tapped with a 10-32 tap. Be careful to keep tool clean and not overheat the part.

Good luck and make on!
